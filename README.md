## 1. Introduction

The global retail chain SuperStore needs to come up with a marketing strategy for Christmas and New Year holidays. This year, they aim to focus on serving existing customers rather than acquiring new ones. SuperStore has two goals through the marketing campaign. First, they want to deliver their appreciation towards current customers. Second, they want to convert a group of existing buyers into loyal ones.

The first step in planning a marketing plan is understanding customer profiles. A data analyst will help marketers to segment existing customers. Marketers then can tailor marketing plan suitable for each customer group. Thus, SuperStore can effectively deliver its thanks to existing customers. Additionally, marketers can also identify the characteristics of customers who can be converted into loyalists to SuperStore. 

Customer segmentation can be based on different criteria. Recency - Frequency - Monetary are three useful criteria for companies operating in the retail industry. Thus, SuperStore's analyst will employ this framework to categorize existing buyers.
